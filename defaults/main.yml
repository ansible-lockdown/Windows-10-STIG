# Global Variables

win10stig_min_ansible_version: "2.16"

# This parameter disables controls that could have a very lengthy find. For example
# removing all files of a specific file type that search the entire drive.
# If there is an action tied to the lengthy search the action task will be disabled as well.
# WN10-00-000130 - CAT2
# Default: true
win10stig_lengthy_search: true

# win_skip_for_test is used in the playbook to skip over certain controls that
# may cause breaking changes when running it for testing purposes.  These generally consist of winrmvi host controls
# that are needed to keep the ansible connection alive.
# Controls that will be skipped:
# WN10-CC-000330 - CAT1 - Disables WinRM Allow Client Basic Auth
# WN10-CC-000345 - CAT1 - Disables WinRM Allow Service Basic Auth
# WN10-CC-000335 - CAT2 - The Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client must not allow unencrypted traffic.
# WN10-CC-000350 - CAT2 - The Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service must not allow unencrypted traffic.
# WN10-SO-000005 - CAT2 - Disables Built-In Admin Account
