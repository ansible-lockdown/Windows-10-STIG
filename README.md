Role Variables
--------------

This role is designed that the end user should not have to edit the tasks themselves. All customizing should be done via the defaults/main.yml file or with extra vars within the project, job, workflow, etc. These variables can be found [here](https://github.com/ansible-lockdown/Windows-10-STIG/wiki/Main-Variables) in the Main Variables Wiki page. All variables are listed there along with descriptions.

Tags
----

There are many tags available for added control precision. Each control has it's own set of tags noting the control number as well as what parts of the system that control addresses.

Below is an example of the tag section from a control within this role. Using this example if you set your run to skip all controls with the tag ssh, this task will be skipped. The
opposite can also happen where you run only controls tagged with ssh.

```sh
tags:
    - WN10-00-000005
    - CAT2
    - CCI-000366
    - SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227
    - SV-220697r569187_rule
    - 220697
```
